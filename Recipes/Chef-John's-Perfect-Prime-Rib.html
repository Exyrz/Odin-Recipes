        <h2>Recipe description</h2>
        <p>Use my easy "mathematical method" for cooking prime rib, and you'll be rewarded with the best prime rib that's perfectly pink and delicious. For the math to work, you must leave the beef out at room temperature for at least 6 hours.</p>
        <h2>Prime rib tips</h2>
        <p>If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you. Here are some tips from Chef John to get you started:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the formula: Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes. For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.</p></li>
            <li><p>You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. (Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.) Then turn off the oven and wait 2 hours without opening the door. When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare.</p></li>
            <li><p>Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature! This is critical in order for the math to work!</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve your prime rib with Chef John's Beef Au Jus and Horseradish Sauce.</p></li>
        </ol>
