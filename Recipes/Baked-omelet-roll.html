        <h2>Recipe description</h2>
        <p>This omelet is so easy and delicious. It bakes in the oven, so there is no watching the stove. My son loves to make it for us.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
