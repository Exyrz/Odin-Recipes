        <h2>Recipe description</h2>
        <p>This honey cake can be made in three different ways: the hard way, the harder way, and how we're going to do it — the hardest way... Because it's that worth it.</p><p>The secret to this cake's fantastic flavor is the tiny amount of bitterness from burnt honey. The slightly tangy whipped cream frosting provides a bit of acidity and lovely light texture, and unlike other frostings, it's not too sweet.</p>
